# Open Space
The project covers the basics of JS, HTML, and CSS. You will learn how to position and design elements, work with different inputs, and even create animation using JS.

Have you ever dreamt about exploring deep space? In this project, you'll create a simple web game where you launch a rocket from an uninhabited planet. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to complete this project: we will start from the ground up by learning how to implement an HTML skeleton of a page and use CSS. Then, we'll learn how to make the game interactive with JS, and by the end of the project, you'll have a firm knowledge foundation for developing your frontend skills.

## Stages
**Stage 1/5: Launchpad**\
Organize prepared materials to make the outline of your game. Learn how to position elements and set a background.

**Stage 2/5: Control deck**\
Explore a variety of HTML inputs and create a dummy control deck.

**Stage 3/5: One small step for man...**\
Add some CSS to make your dummy panel a little fancier and learn how to set gradient with CSS.

**Stage 4/5: X-files**\
Protect the rocket launch panel: make all the buttons disabled until the user enters the correct password.

**Stage 5/5: 3... 2... 1... Liftoff!**\
It's time for the great launch! Make the rocket fly when all the controls are set in the right position.
